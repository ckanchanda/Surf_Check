# Surf_Check

## Overview

As a diehard lover of the ocean and surfing, and a user of surf resources such as surfline and magicseaweed, we were inspired to create our own website that can predict surf forecasts in the Golden State of California. The purpose of this project will be to analyze the best surfing conditions in popular surfing locations within California using the given parameters of: temperature, swell size + period + direction, wind direction, etc.
