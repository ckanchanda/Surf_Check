## Introduction
The purpose of this project will be to analyze the best surfing conditions in popular surfing locations within California using the given parameters of: temperature, swell size + period + direction, wind direction, etc. As a diehard lover of the ocean and surfing, and a user of surf resources such as surfline and magicseaweed, we were inspired to create our own website that can predict surf forecasts in the Golden State of California. 

Programs Used:
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook

## Dataset
Our dataset was generated in two parts:
- A list of surf-able beaches in California from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_beaches_in_California)
- Said beaches' weathers pulled from [World Weather Online API](https://www.worldweatheronline.com/developer/api/docs/marine-weather-api.aspx#q)
