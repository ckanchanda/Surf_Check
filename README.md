## Introduction
The purpose of this project will be to analyze the best surfing conditions in popular surfing locations within California using the given parameters of: temperature, swell size + period + direction, wind direction, etc. As a diehard lover of the ocean and surfing, and a user of surf resources such as surfline and magicseaweed, we were inspired to create our own website that can predict surf forecasts in the Golden State of California.
